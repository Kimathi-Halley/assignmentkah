              various components of a computer system—such as the CPU, memory, <br>
              and input/output (I/O) devices—enabling them to exchange data and control signals.  </p>

               Data Transfer: Moves data between the CPU and peripheral devices.<br>
               Address Decoding: Identifies which device should communicate based on address signals.<br>

            <p> Programmed I/O:<br>
              - The CPU actively polls the I/O device to check if it’s ready.<br>

              - Suitable for low-speed devices with infrequent data transfer.<br><br>
              
              Interrupt-Driven I/O:<br>
              - The device signals the CPU via an interrupt when it is ready.<br>
              - The CPU executes an interrupt service routine to handle the I/O.<br>
              - Reduces CPU idle time compared to polling.<br>
              - More efficient for devices that transfer data at irregular intervals.<br><br>
              
              Direct Memory Access (DMA):<br>
              - A dedicated DMA controller transfers data directly between the I/O device and memory.<br>

            </p>
            <p>  Multiple I/O modules are connected to a common interrupt controller.<br>
              When any module requires service, it sends an interrupt signal to the CPU via this controller.<br>
              The interrupt controller either:<br>
                  • Provides a unique interrupt vector (vectored interrupts), or<br>
                  • Holds status information that the CPU can poll to determine which device triggered the interrupt.<br>
               Using the vector or by reading the controller’s status register, the CPU identifies the source.<br>
               It then jumps to the corresponding interrupt service routine to handle the specific I/O module's request.<br>

            <p> Memory is characterized by its capacity, speed, volatility, cost, and reliability. <br>
              Capacity refers to the total data it can hold. <br>
               Speed involves both the access time (latency) and the data transfer rate (bandwidth).<br> 
               Volatility distinguishes between memory that loses data when power is off lik DRAM and that which retains data (e.g., flash).<br>
                Cost per bit and reliability, including error correction features, 
                further define its effectiveness, along with the underlying organization and addressing scheme.<br>

              Random Access:<br>
              Any memory location can be accessed independently and with uniform speed.<br>

            </p>
            <p> A cache is a small, high-speed memory that temporarily stores frequently accessed data<br>
               and instructions to reduce the time required to fetch them from main memory.<br>
                It is located on or very close to the CPU, or on the processor chip itself.

            </p>
            <p> A cache is organized into fixed-size blocks that store copies of data from main memory.<br>
               These blocks are arranged in a specific mapping scheme—direct-mapped, set-associative, <br>
               or fully associative—which determines how main memory addresses map to cache locations.<br>
               HOW IT WORKS: When the CPU requests data, the cache checks for a matching tag to quickly return the data;<br>
                if not, the appropriate block is fetched from main memory and stored in the cache.

               Every write updates both the cache and main memory immediately.<br>
               Ensures strong data consistency.<br>
               Can incur slower performance due to increased memory traffic.<br><br>
              
              Write-Back:<br>
               Writes update only the cache, marking the block as "dirty."<br>
               Main memory is updated only when the dirty block is evicted.<br>
               Improves performance by reducing write operations to main memory but requires extra logic for data consistency.

            </p>
            <p> Mapping Functions:
               Direct Mapping: Each main memory block maps to one specific cache line. 
               Fully Associative: A memory block can be placed in any cache line. 
               Set-Associative: The cache is divided into sets, and a memory block can be placed in any line within a particular set. 
              
              Replacement Algorithms:
               Least Recently Used (LRU): Evicts the block that has not been accessed for the longest period.
               First-In, First-Out (FIFO): Removes the oldest block in the set based on the order in which blocks were loaded.
               Least Frequently Used (LFU): Evicts the block that has been accessed the fewest times.
